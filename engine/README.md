# Poietra Engine

This workspace is the renderer-neutral Rust experiment described by
[`ADR 0002`](../docs/adr/0002-poietra-engine-ir-contracts.md). It deliberately
has no Tauri, Electron, browser, or GPU dependency.

- `poietra-scene-ir`: strict versioned JSON wire types and validation.
- `poietra-geometry`: deterministic cubic geometry and easing primitives.
- `poietra-eval`: pure `SceneIrV1` to `RenderPacketV1` frame sampling.

Run the workspace checks with:

```sh
cargo fmt --all --manifest-path engine/Cargo.toml -- --check
cargo test --locked --workspace --manifest-path engine/Cargo.toml
cargo clippy --locked --workspace --all-targets --all-features --manifest-path engine/Cargo.toml -- -D warnings
```

Both evaluators consume the JSON fixtures under `fixtures/engine-v1`; categorical
results are exact and floating-point results use the fixture's explicit combined
absolute/relative tolerance. The TypeScript evaluator remains Studio's current
implementation while the Rust path is experimental. This workspace is not yet
connected to Studio and does not contain a renderer or WASM boundary.

Untrusted contract JSON is rejected before deserialization above the 8 MiB
envelope limit. Asset bytes are resolved out of band and are not part of that
limit.
